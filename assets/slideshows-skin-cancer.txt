A sunscreen's SPF rating refers to its ability to absorb UVB rays and prevent them from damaging skin. Though there is no method to measure a sunscreen&rsquo;s ability to absorb UVA radiation, products that block UVB are thought to block UVA too. Thus, the higher a sunscreen's SPF rating, the more radiation it's absorbing and the better it's protecting your skin.<\/p>","image":"http:\/\/thcn-db01.bar.tpg.corp\/files\/8113\/0695\/0721\/sunblockspf30.jpg"},{"id":"681","title":"Check the Ingredients","text":"<p>An effective sunscreen should have a SPF rating at of least 15 and contain the ingredients <strong>avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide<\/strong>. Zinc oxide tends to be more opaque (you&rsquo;ve probably seen the comical &ldquo;white noses&rdquo; it can give wearers!), and is thus not as cosmetically desirable. Newer sunscreens will be less obvious. As for expiration dates, sunscreens remain at full strength for up to three years. If your sunscreen is past its expiration date, replace it.<\/p>","image":"http:\/\/thcn-db01.bar.tpg.corp\/files\/7113\/0695\/2021\/lookatlabel.jpg"},{"id":"682","title":"Wear Enough of It","text":"<p>Most people apply only 25 to 50 percent of the amount recommended to protect their skin.

This means reapplying the product within this 30-minute to 3-hour window of time is a good rule of thumb.
