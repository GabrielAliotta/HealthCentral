Everyone responds to medication differently. We all have a unique body chemistry and will metabolize medication in our own way. Nobody can really predict what will happen when you take a pill.

Although it is hard to narrow it down, figuring out what that one item is can help. For example, imagine you are worried about losing your job. You might obsess over a mistake you made, a conversation with your boss, the financial stability of the company. But your real worry is that you may lose your job.

By doing so, you are ignoring all of what you have accomplished. Remember, most situations are not defined by one single moment but instead a result of cumulative events.
